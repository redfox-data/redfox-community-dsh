# XHS Copywriting Score / xiaohongshu-note-analyzer

---

## Introduction

Powered by **2000+** viral notes collected daily across the platform, this skill scores your Xiaohongshu (XHS) copywriting across multiple dimensions, delivers concrete improvement suggestions, and helps you boost content quality and traffic performance.

**Core Value**

- **Real data foundation**: Every score is grounded in live viral notes retrieved on demand — not rule-of-thumb judgment — so every conclusion is traceable.
- **Four-dimension scoring**: Keyword coverage, structural completeness, timeliness, and content quality are scored individually, pinpointing weak spots at a glance.
- **Actionable improvement guidance**: Only the underperforming sections are rewritten; your original voice and style stay intact.

**Who It's For**

- 📝 **XHS Creators** — Run a quick quality check before publishing to reduce the chance of low traffic.
- 🛍️ **Brand / E-commerce Operators** — Measure how well promotional copy aligns with current viral patterns.
- 🏢 **MCN / Content Teams** — Review content at scale and establish a quantifiable copywriting quality standard.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Keyword Coverage Analysis**: Compares your copy against high-frequency words in viral notes from the same niche to identify missing traffic keywords.
- **Structural Completeness Scoring**: Checks for key viral elements — opening hook, bulleted tips, and engagement call-to-action.
- **Timeliness Assessment**: Evaluates whether the copy connects to recent trends, seasons, or holidays to enhance contextual relevance.
- **Content Quality Evaluation**: Measures readability through tip density, layout clarity, and emoji usage.
- **Precision Optimization**: Upon confirmation, only low-scoring sections are revised — high-scoring parts remain untouched to avoid full rewrites.
