# Xiaohongshu Title Generator & Scorer / xiaohongshu-title-score

---

## Overview

Based on continuously collected viral note data from across the platform, we analyze viral title patterns and generate 10 quality viral titles in one click; meanwhile, we score existing titles across six weighted dimensions, delivering grade ratings and optimization suggestions.

**Core Value**

- **Generate + Score dual mode**: Create new titles based on viral patterns or evaluate existing titles' viral potential—two capabilities covering the full content creation workflow.
- **Data-driven creation**: Based on real-time viral data rather than guesswork, each title comes with a match score and a reference viral link—grounded in evidence.
- **Precision without drift**: Whatever product you input, samples are aligned strictly to that direction, without expanding into unrelated categories.

**Intended Users**

- 📝 **Xiaohongshu creators** — Stop agonizing over titles; use data-driven patterns to improve click-through and exposure.
- 🛍️ **Brand / e-commerce operators** — Quickly produce multiple title options from product keywords, and score to pick the best version.
- 🏢 **MCN / content planners** — Batch proposals and title optimization in the same niche, building reusable title formulas.

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Viral title generation**: Enter a keyword, analyze real-time viral patterns first, then create 10 new titles—each with a match score, reference link, and recommendation reason.
- **Viral title scoring**: Enter an existing title and keyword, score across six weighted dimensions (topic relevance, structural compliance, benefit clarity, emotional arousal, scarcity perception, compliance safety), output a grade (S / A / B / C) with optimization suggestions.
- **Keyword precision**: Whatever product you enter, only that product form is queried, with strict form boundaries (cream ≠ spray ≠ clothing); broad category keywords first recommend sub-niches for you to confirm.
- **Smart time strategy**: When samples are insufficient, the query time range is automatically expanded (recent 1 → 3 → 7 → 30 days), without changing your core keyword.

### Highlights

- **Product form precision**: Whatever product form you enter, it is strictly limited to that scope—no expansion into unrelated categories.
- **Six-dimension scoring system**: Topic relevance, structural compliance, benefit clarity, emotional arousal, scarcity perception, compliance safety—six dimensions fully quantify a title's viral potential.
- **Dual-function mode**: Generation and scoring in one tool—create new titles or evaluate existing ones, covering the full workflow from topic selection to publication.
