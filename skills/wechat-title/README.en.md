## Features

### Core Features

- **Title Generation**: Enter a topic, keyword, or niche — the tool first analyzes viral title patterns, then creates 10 new titles, each with a match score, reference viral article link, and recommendation reason.
- **Title Scoring**: Enter an existing title — get a four-dimension evaluation (niche match, click incentive, structure compliance, viral potential) scored out of 100, with optimization suggestions and reference viral titles.
- **Smart Keyword Handling**: Broad category terms trigger a sub-direction recommendation for you to confirm first; specific terms go straight to data matching.
- **Auto Time Expansion**: When data is insufficient, the query time range is automatically expanded — your core keyword is never changed without your consent.
