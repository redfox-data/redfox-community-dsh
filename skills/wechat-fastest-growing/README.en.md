- Accepts natural language date input — "latest", "yesterday", or "March 15" all work
- Optionally drill into viral article patterns and track-level strategy summaries based on real ranking data

**Who It's For**

- ✍️ WeChat Official Account operators — quickly discover the fastest-growing benchmark accounts and viral topics in your track
- 📋 Content editors — use rankings for topic review sessions and extract replicable playbooks
- 🔍 Researchers / analysts — observe track heat shifts and single-day data fluctuations

## Features

### Core Capabilities

- **Growth rate rankings**: Fetch reading growth rate rankings by date, output as raw Markdown table with clickable links to original articles
- **Natural language date parsing**: Supports "latest", "yesterday", "YYYY-MM-DD"; auto-falls back to the day before if yesterday's data is unavailable
- **Growth trend analysis**: Based on real ranking data, outputs a viral article analysis table (≤5 entries), a content-type analysis table (≤5 entries), and a 300–500 word summary
- **Composite score index**: Rankings include a weighted score field measuring the combined performance of reads, forwards, likes, and "Top Reads"

### Highlights

- Script output is shown verbatim — the model is not allowed to rewrite or reorder ranking content, ensuring data integrity
- Any date within the past 30 days is queryable; out-of-range requests are clearly flagged rather than fabricated
